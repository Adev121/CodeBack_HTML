      Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is
      credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In
      seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a
      genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led
      McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the
      Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman
      philosopher Cicero. In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear
      an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with
      the most notable passage excerpted below: “Neque porro quisquam est, qui
      dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia
      non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam
      quaerat voluptatem.” A 1914 English translation by Harris Rackham reads:
      “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
      itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which
      toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.” McClintock's eye for
